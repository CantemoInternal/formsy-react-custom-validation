setFormPristine()
		sets the form and all inputs to pristine
		an input has formSubmitted and isPristine in state but the form only has formSubmitted, both are set, formSubmitted = !isPristine
		formPristine should be passed as a prop, not copied to input state

isFormDisabled()
		redundant, should just pass formDisabled boolean prop to inputs

mapModel()
		wtf is it doing when there's no mapping... I guess enforcing . notation?


validateForm()
		turn setState into functional

setInputValidationErrors
		turn setState into functional

updateInputsWithErrors
		maybe optimize to call setState only once

attachToForm, detachFromFrom
		these still needed? if not move method calls that are still needed to addStateToForm and removeStateFromForm
